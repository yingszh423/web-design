  	    <p> Hi everyone, this is Yingshi Zhang. You can call me Eunice as well. I am a junior majoring in Data Science with minors in Business Studies and Web Programming and Applications. I am from <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g298555-Guangzhou_Guangdong-Vacations.html/">Guangzhou, China</a>. It is not only my <a href="hometown.html">hometown</a> but also my favourite city in the world. If you come to Guangzhou by any chance, let me know and I'll give you a tour. I currently reside in Long Island City with my <a href="roommate.html">roommate</a>, who never pay the rent and only shower once a month. You can navigate to another page to see his <a href="roommate.html">picture</a>. In terms of <a href="interest.html">interests and hobbies</a>, I enjoy tasting coffee and making pour-over at home. I also like playing volleyball, frisbee, and golf(still learning). For whom share the common interest, please invite me and let's have fun!</p>
