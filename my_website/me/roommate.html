      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>This is my roommate who never pays the rent and only shower once a month. Yet, he is still my best friend, a charming companion. His name is Wuutau, because in Cantonese, taro is pronounced as "wuutau", which is one of my favourite food. He is a ragamuffin cat, origin from California. Wuutau is a gentle and friendly cat who never fights or scratches people, making him a peaceful companion. He's easy-going and particularly picky about his food, with tuna being his absolute favorite.</p>
