	  			<h3>LIME</h3>
	  			<p>Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) is a technique that helps us understand why machine learning models make certain decisions. Imagine you have a complex model that acts like a black box, where you input data and get a decision, but you don't know what's happening inside. LIME solves this by creating a simpler model that approximates and explains the decision-making of the complex model, but only around the specific data point you're interested in. It works by approximating the model locally around the prediction of interest. </p>

	  			<h3>SHAP</h3>
	  			<p>SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is a unified approach to understand model's output for making machine learning models interpretable. It draws from the game-theoretic concept of Shapley values to assign each feature of a model an importance value for a particular prediction. This approach ensures equity by attributing the predictionfairly among the features. The SHAP value is the average marginal contribution of a feature value over all possible combinations. Most importantly, by allowing interaction term, SHAP captures not just the effect of a single feature but also the interaction effects with other features, presenting a comprehensive picture of the impact on the output. </p>
